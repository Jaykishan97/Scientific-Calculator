# Calculator Program
This is a calculator program written in Java that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced scientific functions such as square root, exponentiation, and logarithms.

### Getting Started
To use the calculator, simply run the Calculator class from the command line or from an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. The program will prompt you to select an operation to perform, and then prompt you to enter the operands for that operation. The program will then compute the result and display it to the user.

### Features
The Calculator program has the following features:

* Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
* Scientific functions (square root, exponentiation, and logarithms)
* User-friendly interface that prompts users for input and displays results
* Error handling for invalid input
* Code structured using multiple classes, packages, and interfaces for easy maintainability and extensibility

### Future Enhancements
Here are some possible enhancements that could be made to the Calculator program in the future:

* Memory functionality to store and recall results
* History functionality to keep track of previous calculations
* Graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive user experience
* Unit conversion functionality for length, weight, and volume
* Currency conversion functionality
* Scientific constants and units for more advanced calculations
* Complex number functionality
* Expression evaluation functionality
* Binary, octal, and hexadecimal conversions
* Bitwise operations on binary numbers
